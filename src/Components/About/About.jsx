                Hello! My name is Diego Manuel Viera Mart√≠nez, and I am a Computer Science student passionate about software development and technology. My native language is Spanish, and I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow in the programming world.
                <br/><br/>
                I am a big fan of Apple and love to explore their technologies and ecosystems. I also have a strong interest in game development, where I can apply my creativity and technical skills. I enjoy participating in collaborative projects, where I can use my knowledge and acquire new skills. I am particularly interested in areas such as artificial intelligence, web development, and systems programming.
                <br/><br/>
                My hobbies include creating pixel art and going to the gym to stay healthy and fit. These activities help me stay creative and balanced. I am excited to contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with other technology enthusiasts.
                <br/><br/>
                If you have a project in mind or just want to chat about technology, feel free to reach out!
